This directory contains two Java programs for Stanford's OOP class:
a Sudoku game solver with a Java Swing interface, and a basic 
model-view-controller project for interacting with a MySQL database 
(will not work without valid information in MyDBInfo.java file)

SudokuFrame.java provides the view for entering and solving a Sudoku game, 
the logic of which is encapsulated in Sudoku.java. Games are entered as a 
string, where 0s represent empty grid locations. It solves the game 
recursively starting with the MOST constrained locations first. It will 
attempt to find all possible solutions, and will display one randomly upon 
finish, along with the time it took to solve.

MetropolisFrame provides the main() that initializes the GUI implementation 
that provides a view for the metropolis database. MetropolisTableModel.java
implements controller logic and interacts with the SQL database/model 
**note: implementation subject to SQL injections (learned later)

The doc/ folder contains javadoc-generated documentation for 
MetropolisTableModel.java
